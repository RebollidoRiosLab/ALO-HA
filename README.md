# Allergy Linking Oncology Human Analyses (ALO‚Ä¢HA)

**ALO‚Ä¢HA** is an interactive **Shiny** application developed by the [RebollidoRiosLab](https://rebollidorioslab.com/)  
for the AllergoOncology research community. It enables exploration of allergy-related omics data in a publication-aware and biologically contextualized way.

## üîç Features

1. **Browse & Filter Publications**  
   Instantly filter studies by year range, publication type, cell origin, disorder, sample source, study design, and molecule sets.  

2. **Visualize Associations**  
   Explore network graphs and Sankey diagrams showing relationships between molecules, disorders, and sample sources.  

3. **Reactome Pathway Enrichment**  
   Run pathway enrichment analysis for any selected subset of molecules.  

4. **Dynamic Plots & Tables**  
   Every plot, network, Sankey, and data table updates **in real time** whenever you change **any** filter or selection.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Real-Time Recalculation & Busy Indicator

As soon as a user adjusts any filter (e.g., year range, disorder, molecule), ALO‚Ä¢HA automatically recalculates and refreshes:
- Annual trends barplots  
- Association networks  
- Sankey diagrams  
- Pathway enrichment heatmaps  
- Downloadable data tables  

During recalculation, a **fulfilling-square spinner** overlays the entire app interface and disappears once **all** outputs have updated.

## üìÇ Downloadable Data

This repository provides two curated CSV files supporting transparency and reproducibility of the ALO‚Ä¢HA Shiny app:

### 1. [`data/aloha_molecule_data.csv`](data/aloha_molecule_data.csv)

A molecule-centric summary containing **451 molecules**, annotated with:
- The **studies** in which they were reported  
- Corresponding **sample sources**  
- Associated **diseases**

This file is also available directly within the ALO‚Ä¢HA web application (*Help* tab ‚Üí *FAQs* section).

---

### 2. [`data/aloha_articles_metadata.csv`](data/aloha_articles_metadata.csv)

Metadata for the **138 curated articles** used as the primary annotation source for ALO‚Ä¢HA. This selection is the input for all downstream analysis and corresponds to **Table S1** in our paper.

**Included fields:**
- `pmid` ‚Äì PubMed ID  
- `pubmed` ‚Äì Full PubMed citation  
- `year` ‚Äì Publication year  
- `doi` ‚Äì Digital Object Identifier  
- `pubtype` ‚Äì Publication type (e.g., original research, review)  
- `disorder` ‚Äì Allergy subtype or disease  
- `MeSH_IDs` ‚Äì Associated MeSH terms  
- `abbrev` ‚Äì Custom short name for article  
- `db` ‚Äì Database origin (if applicable)  
- `source` ‚Äì Text-mining or manual curation  
- `molecules` ‚Äì Molecules identified in the study  
- `sample` ‚Äì Sample type (e.g., blood, nasal fluid)  
- `cell_origin` ‚Äì Cell-type origin (if available)  
- `gene_number` ‚Äì Number of genes/molecules reported  
- `study_type` ‚Äì Experimental design (e.g., case-control, cohort)

## üë©‚Äçüî¨ Who Should Use ALO‚Ä¢HA?

- **Immunologists** and **allergologists** exploring molecular underpinnings of allergic disorders  
- **Bioinformaticians** analyzing gene-pathway associations in allergy-oncology interfaces  
- **Researchers** seeking an interactive, publication-linked tool for filtering, visualization, and analysis of allergy-relevant data
